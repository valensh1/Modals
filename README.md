## Overview
This is an application that displays a modal (popup window) for when a user clicks on a button. Modals are very common in almost every website.

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out a fully functional modal window by adding and removing element classes upon button clicks (eventListeners). The classes were styled in CSS and basically when an element has a class of 'hidden' it means to display nothing and when an element DOES NOT have the 'hidden' class it displays according to how the element was styled in CSS.
